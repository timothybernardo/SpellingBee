# SUMMARY

Please read and follow the assignment instructions on Canvas. Please put your answers
here after the italicized instructions (indicated by underscores).

## What are the GitHub team name, user names, and repository URL? [1 point]

_We need this information to grade your assignment._

hw7-timothybernardo, timothybernardo, https://github.com/Fundies-2-Oakland/homework-7-hw7-timothybernardo

## Did you successfully implement everything that was requested? [1 point]

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not
pass._

Yes.

## How long do you estimate the assignment took? [1 point]

_Estimate the number of hours or minutes. Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure,
give the average of the range so we can enter the estimate in a spreadsheet._

This assignment took around 6 hours.

## Who did you work with and how? [1 point]

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Please state whether you attended any office hours. We especially
like hearing about helpful TAs._

I worked by myself and did not attend any office hours

## What was your AI usage? [1 point]

_State explicitly (yes or no) whether you used AI. If so, say which tools you
used and what your prompts were. Your assignment will not be graded if you do
not answer this question._

I did use AI. I asked ChatGPT "How does the Collection.shuffle() function work". This allowed me
to implement a button that shuffled the letters in my game. I also asked ChatGPT "What are the benefits of HashSets".
It stated that HashSets are fast with O(1) runtime when accessing/finding and element and prevents duplicates. Using
this
knowledge, I use a HashSet to stored found words by the user to prevent duplicated found words.

## What other resources did you use? [1 point]

_Please give specific URLs (not "Stack Overflow" or "Google") and state which
ones were particularly helpful. You do not need to list course materials._

Other resources that I used for this project included the Hashing and Equality slideshow to learn more
about
HashSets (https://northeastern-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/r_bhalerao_northeastern_edu/EWSYVZU8EAJCo4JSuuacYgUB9xhR91D7Iav63fA43uVRpA?e=2GmbBK).
I also used the Meows in a GUI homework assignment to remind myself how to load and read a file (the dictionary for this
game): (https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/202024/assignments/2643742).

## Reflections [4 points]

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to **all** of these questions:_

* _What was the most difficult part of the assignment?_
* _What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?_
* _What did you learn doing the assignment?_

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours,
and lecture are always welcome, as is feedback about TAs. If you implemented
extra milestones, say so here._

The most difficult part of this assignment was refactoring the code in milestone 4. I had trouble
changing the structure of my code so the score updates everytime a user gets a word in the foundWords list,
Eventually, through various helper methods and experimentation, I was able to update scores accurately and
still sustain the solveWords() method's functionality. The most rewarding part of this assignment was seeing
my code actually work, as I play Spelling Bee during my free time. It felt accomplishing to code something that
is a part of my everyday routine. I was excited to show my partner this program as he also enjoys playing this game
with me. This was my favorite homework assignment so far in Fundies. From this assignment, I learned how to
work with HashSets and Collections. I learned the importance of refactoring code when needed and using helper methods
that will make code less redundant.
